<h1>Homework 6. Language bindings for TensorFlow</h1>

<p><small>[<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs131/index.html">131 home</a> &gt; <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs131/homework.html">Homework</a>]</small></p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Following up on <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs131/hw/pr.html">the project</a>, suppose you are
trying to run an application server proxy herd on a large set of
virtual machines. Your application uses machine learning algorithms
and relies heavily
on <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>. You've built
a prototype using Python and it runs as well as could be expected on
large queries.</p>

<p>However, your application is unusual in that it handles many
small queries, that create and/or execute models that are tiny by
machine-learning standards. Although typical TensorFlow applications
are bottlenecked inside C++
or <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone">CUDA</a> code
(e.g., in
the <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen</a>
or <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn">cuDNN</a> libraries),
when you benchmark your application you discover that it's spending
most of its time executing Python code to set up your models.</p>

<p>Your boss suggests that a way to speed up performance would be to
convert your application's Python code to some other language, and
then use that instead of Python. You want to keep TensorFlow and
the ability to prototype with Python, but you also want your
application to run efficiently.</p>

<p>One other thing: your boss says that if a small query is initiated
on a client, you should look for approaches that make it easy to
answer the query directly on the client rather than shipping the
problem off to an application server. Although this cannot be done
for all the small queries (as some are initiated by servers or require
resources available only on the servers), it can be done for a
significant number of them.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Review <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/extend/architecture">TensorFlow
Architecture</a>
and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/extend/bindings">TensorFlow
in other languages</a>, and consider three other languages that are
plausible candidates for implementing your application: (1) Java
(see <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java">bindings</a>), (2) OCaml
(see <a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/">bindings</a>),
and (3) <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> (which does not
 have bindings yet, but one can use <a href="https://juliuskunze.com/tensorflow-in-kotlin-native.html">TensorFlow
in Kotlin/Native</a>).
</p>

<p>You already know Java and OCaml from previous assignments.
Familiarize yourself with Kotlin enough to write and test a simple
method <samp>everyNth</samp> that accepts a list L and a positive
integer N and returns a list containing every Nth element of L,
starting with the (N&#8722;1)st element, then the (2N&#8722;1)st
element, and so on until L's elements are exhausted so that the
returned list's size is &#8970;L.size / N&#8971; (where
&#8970;<var>x</var>&#8971; is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">floor</a>
of <var>x</var>). The method should accept a list of any type, should
return a list of the same type, and should consume O(N) time and
space. The returned value should be immutable; any later changes to
the input list should not affect the output list.
Create a Makefile so that the command 'make check' compiles
and runs your test successfully on the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers,
using the Kotlin command-line compiler installed there.
</p>

<p>Do some research on your three languages and support software as a
potential platform. Your research should include an examination of the
language and system documentation to help determine whether it would
be effective. We want an alternative that supports event-driven
servers well, such as the project servers using
Python's <code>asyncio</code>.
</p>

<p>Unlike the project, we are not expecting working prototypes, though
prototypes are welcome.</p>

<p>Write an executive summary that compares the three alternate
approaches to each other and to Python. The
summary should be in 10-point font or larger and should be at most
three pages. You can put references and appendixes in later pages, if
you can't get under the page limit otherwise: the appendixes should contain
any source code or diagrams. Your summary should focus on the
technologies' effects on ease of use, flexibility, generality,
performance, reliability; thie idea is to explore the most-important
technical challenges in doing the proposed rewrite. The summary should
be suitable for software executives, that is, for readers who have
some expertise in software, particularly in managing software
developers, but who are not experts in Java or OCaml or your chosen
language. Please keep the <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs131/comm.html">resources for written
reports and oral presentations</a> in mind, particularly its rubrics
and its advice for citations to sources that you consulted.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit a file <samp>hw6.pdf</samp> containing your summary. Submit
your <samp>everyNth</samp> implementation and test, along with any
other prototype code, as a compressed tarball <samp>hw6.tar.gz</samp>
in the usual way. Your tarball should include a
<samp>Makefile</samp> such that the command <samp>make check</samp>
builds and runs your test case. You can augment the makefile
to build and run any other prototype code you submit.</p>
