First, problem 2.89 in the textbook. In your answers, assume -fwrapv, and explain
which of your answers require this assumption and why. Submit a plain ASCII text
file named 'random.txt'.

Second, problem 2.90 in the textbook, except compute 4**x rather than 2**x and
call the resulting function fpwr4 instead of fpwr2. Submit a source-code file
named 'fpwr4.c' that contains all the source code for fpwr4, preceded by the
definition of a function 'static float u2f(unsigned u) { ... }' that returns a
value as described in 2.90 (you fill in the "...").
