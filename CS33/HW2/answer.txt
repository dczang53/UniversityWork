A) Registers %rdi and %ecx store the values for x and n, respectively. Register %rax stores result (initialized to 0). Register %rdx stores mask.
B) Result is initialized as 0, and mask is initialized as 1.
C) The test condition for mask (compare it with itself) is to see if it is equal to 0.
D) Mask is updated by shifting it right by the number enumerated by the last 8 bits of n.
E) Result is updates by OR (|) the current value with (mask & x).
F) see loop.c
