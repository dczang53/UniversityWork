Submit the files smashinglab.txt, thttpd-sp.s, thttpd-as.s, and thttpd-no.s as
described above, along with any other files needed to explain your exploit.

All text files should be ASCII files, with no carriage returns, and with no more
than 200 columns per line. For example, the shell command

expand smashinglab.txt thttpd-sp.s thttpd-as.s thttpd-no.s |
  awk '/\r/ || 200 < length'
should output nothing.

The due is extended to Wednesday.
