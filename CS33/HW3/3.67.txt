[*assume each (number) is a relative memory location]
B) Eval passes a specific memory location of strB to modify and return, along with the individual elements of strA s.
C) The code for process accesses s's elements by using memory addresses relative to the stack pointer (in which s is located just before in a sequence).
D) The code for process sets the fields of r by copying from specific elements of s, accessing these momory locations relative to the stack pointer and moving to the right location relative to the pointer to the first element of r.

F) Struct arguments are passed just like normal arguments: all of its elements are places before the %rsp location and are accessed relative to %rsp. They are returned after allocating some memory space, setting the element fields, and then returning the location of the first element.
