README

lab3a.c:
The C program reads a file system image, with the name given as the first argument. The
program then reads the individual blocks groups, and prints out summaries of the superblocks and
group descriptors, lists the free inodes and blocks, lists all existing files (directory, regualar file,
symbolic link, etc...), lists all directory links, and lists all indirectly referenced blocks.

The program works as follows: (for each group): first make a copy of the superblock and group descriptor table
(the latter to be used to traverse every group) and initialize some information like block size, number of block
groups, etc...; then make a copy of the block bitmap, inode bitmap, and inode table for the group; then traverse
the block bitmap to find all free blocks and list them; then traverse the inode bitmap and list free inodes or
print a summary of the existing file (along with their contents (if directory) or their indirectly refereced blocks).

ext2_fs.h:
The given header file with the structs for the superblock, group descriptor, inode descriptor, directory entry, and
other constants.

Makefile:
The Makefile includes the means to compile the C program, perform smoke tests on the executable, 
tar the files for submission, and clean up the executables if needed. What each option does
can be found below.
(make): Simply compiles the C program into the executable "lab3a" with the -Wall and
-Wextra options with gcc.
(make dist): Simply builds the distributed tarball using the tar command.
(make clean): Simply removes the executable "lab3a" using the rm command
