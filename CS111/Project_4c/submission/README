README

lab4c_tcp.c:
The C program is basically the exact same as lab4b, except that it now uses tcp sockets to
communicate with the server "lever.cs.ucla.edu" on port 18000 (code from lab1b).

lab4c_tls.c:
Basically the same as lab4c_tcp, except that it communicates with the server on port 19000 and
also sets up ssl on top of the tcp connection for encryption.

Makefile:
The Makefile includes the means to compile the C program, perform smoke tests on the executable, 
tar the files for submission, and clean up the executables if needed. What each option does
can be found below.
(default): Simply compiles the C programs into the executables "lab4c_tcp" and "lab4c_tls" with the options
-Wall -Wextra (and library flags -lssl -lcrypto for lab4c_tls and -lmraa -lm fir both) options with gcc.
(dist): Simply builds the distributed tarball using the tar command.
(clean): Simply removes the executables "lab4c_tcp" and "lab4c_tls" with the tarball using the rm command
