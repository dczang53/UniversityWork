(To connect to wifi)
"sudo connmanctl"
"enable wifi"
"scan wifi"
"services"
"agent on"
"connect wifi_2cf7f1066134_55434c415f574946495f524553_managed_none"
"quit"

I used the commands above to connect to UCLA_WIFI_RES.
Then, I used the command "ifconfig" and noted the IP address for my
partner to use to connect to my server.


(Set up account as server)
I first run the following command to make sure that the necessary software
are installed.

"dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh"
(Output:)
openssh-client                                  install
openssh-server                                  install
openssh-sftp-server                             install


Then, to make an account, I did:

"sudo useradd -d /home/guest -m guest"
"root@beaglebone:/home# sudo passwd guest"
(Output:)
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
(password set as "IWELCOMEYOu")


To add a ".ssh" directory for the client and give them ownership:

"cd guest"
"sudo mkdir .ssh"
"sudo chown -R guest .ssh"
"sudo chmod 700 .ssh"





(Logging on as client)
I first run the following command to generate a public and a private key:

"ssh-keygen"
(Output:)
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/root/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
4c:fd:11:41:f6:a2:7b:0e:6b:c0:b5:f8:e3:7a:72:8a root@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+

Then, I run the following to copy the public key to the server for
authentication purposes.

"ssh-copy-id -i dennis@169.232.189.138"
(Output:)
The authenticity of host '169.232.189.138 (169.232.189.138)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 0c:2a:2a:0f:cd:59:29:b4:1d:e0:0c:43:e0:e0:66:3a.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

dennis@169.232.189.138's password:
Number of key(s) added: 1
Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'dennis@169.232.189.138'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.


Then, I used "ssh-add" with my passphrase to the authentication
agent, so that I won't have to type in my password.

Finally, to log in:

"ssh dennis@169.232.189.138"

To make sure that I am really logged in, I ran:

"touch hello.txt" (double checked on my partner's server)
"xterm"
"firefox"
