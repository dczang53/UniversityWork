Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt

1.) man -k ["word to search"]
(Found by entering "man man" and looking under "OPTIONS")

2.) /bin/cp
    /usr/bin/wc
(Note that both programs are command line commands readily accessible, using
"which cp" and "which wc" would show the locations of the programs accessed
through the PATH environment variable)

3.) "." - Builtin command that executes a file
    (found in both "/bin" and "/usr/bin")

    "w" - Shows who is logged in, and the processes each are currently running
    (found in "/usr/bin")

    "[" - Builtin expression to evaluate conditionals
    (found in "/usr/bin")

    "X" - Command that runs the X Window System
    (found in "/usr/bin")

(These commands are found by using "find /usr/bin -name "?"" and
"find /bin -name "?"" from the root directory "/". What they do can be found
by using "man "command"".)

4.) /etc/alternatives/emacs
(WHen we use "ls -l | grep "emacs" in the "/usr/bin" directory, we see that
"emacs" points to the above location.)

5.) In terms of file permission, as mentioned in the discussions,
"chmod g+s "filename"" would give the users in the group the permission to
run the executable as the owner. "chmod o-x "filename"" would remove the
permission to execute the file from others.

6.) The "-ctime" option allows one to find files that were modifies n days
ago. This option is found by using "man find" and looking under the "TESTS"
section.

7.) This would be possible by using "find -ctime 21 -type d" in the root ("/")
directory, and would end up being a long list, but I cannot access many of the
other directories because I am a student user.

8.) "find" is located in "/usr/bin". We go to this directory and run
"find -type l | wc" (doing this will first create a list of all symbolic links
and then inputing that into wc will allow us to get a newline count, which
corresponds to the number of results). There are 351 symbolic links.

9.) To find the oldest file, we use "ls -lt" in the "/usr/bin" directory and
look for the last entry with the permission bit not starting with a 'd'
(indicating that it is a directory). The oldest file is "sgmiwhich".

10.) "locale" gets its information from its environment variables, like
"LC_TYPE" and "LC_COLLATE" (can be found using "man locale").

11.) Use "C-h a sort" in emacs (as stated in the pdf)
Buffer-menu-sort
Buffer-menu-sort-by-column
ibuffer-invert-sorting
ibuffer-toggle-sorting-mode
rmail-sort-by-author
rmail-sort-by-correspondent
rmail-sort-by-date
rmail-sort-by-labels
rmail-sort-by-lines
rmail-sort-by-recipient
rmail-sort-by-subject
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields

12.) Using "C-h k C-M-a" "C-h k C-M-h", we can find the definitions for
"C-M-a" and "C-M-h". ("C-h k" is found in the pdf.)
"C-M-a" moves the cursor backwards to the beginning of a defun (a compiled
Lisp function).
"C-M-h" marks the end of the current defun (containing or following point).

13.) According to "C-h k C-g", "C-g" runs the compiled Lisp function for
command keyboard-quit. More specifically, it causes a quit directly when
Lisp code is being executed.

14.) Using "C-h f yank", we can find the description for "yank".
(Again, "C-h f" is found in the pdf.)
"yank" essentially "pastes" the last stretch of text killed.

15.) Using the two commands, the only difference is the inclusion of
"." and ".." for "M-x dired" in emacs.
