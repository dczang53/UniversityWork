The upper half of the screen is divided into three parts. The left screen
displays the structure of the repository with each head organized into
branches. The middle screen displays who commited the changes and their
emails. The right column shows the date the commit was made.
The lower half is divided into two parts, and generally shows the information
of a commit selected from the upper half. The left screen shows the ChangeLoc
information of the commit and sometimes the file changes from the diff files
(not shown in this case). The right screen shows the files changed by the
commit (in this case, only comment is changed).
