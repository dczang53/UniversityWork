First, I create a new branch from v3.0 called quote.
"git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'


3.)
Here, I applied the patch from the lab portion to the new branch.
"patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt"
(Output:)
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

Here, I made a new ChangeLog using emacs.
"emacs"
"C-x 4 a"
We find the entry for the change in the lab portion from git-log.txt, and
adapting the change log.


6.)
After doing the above, I commited the changes for the branch.
"git add ."
"git commit -F ChangeLog"


7.)
Finally, I created the patch file for the changes I made and commited.
"git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt"

Here, I tested my partner's patch.
(patch provider: Eric Zhang)
(UID: 104781338)
(formatted-patch-ez.txt)

"git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'"
"git am formatted-patch-ez.txt"

(I basically check for no ` in the output when I ran "src/diff . -"
and "src/diff --help". I don't think is was correct.)

First, change back to my own branch:
"git checkout quote"

"make distdir"

    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
    
    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
    `like this' or ``like this''.

Here, we first download Xming, and run it before running Putty.
When we run Putty, we first make sure the "Enable X11 forwarding" is enabled.
Then, after logging in, we run:
"ssh -X dennisz@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu" (to enable X11 forwarding)
"cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs"
"export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH" (to allow for gitk to run)
"gitk"

Finally, we proceed to screenshot the Xming page and proceed to
gitk-description.txt.
